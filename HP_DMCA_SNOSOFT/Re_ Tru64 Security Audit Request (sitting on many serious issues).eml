To whom it may concern,

Applying this law to this situation implies that we are attempting to make
(Compaq) do something against their own will. If I remember correctly Compaq
never flat out told us "No SnoSoft we do not with to work with you". Based
on that it is not entirely clear to me when it was established just what
exactly the "Will of Compaq" was. If Compaq has "Determined its will" on
this issue it would have been nice of them to communicate it with us
effectively. If we were to continue to offer our assistance or attempt to
force our assistance AFTER which we were told that our assistance was not
needed or wanted THEN and only THEN can I see this as "going against their
will". If you act like you will work with someone and then just don't say
anything to them for a few weeks ... one should expect another attempt at
communication (hence our multiple attempts). If the will of Compaq was never
identified to us then this can hardly be used as a point of argument.

Another portion implies "malicious intent" to injur property or a person...
plain and simple there were NO threats made against any individual or
property intellectual or otherwise. We have in no way added any threat
factor to Compaq ... the conditions by which their operating system is
vulnerable were not introduced by us. By disclosing information about a
vulnerability in their operating system we in no way "Damage" the TRU64
OS... it is already broken. We are simply pointing out where it is broken.

If I were the person that pointed out that Firestone tires on the Ford
explorer are the cause of serious wrecks I would not be accused of making
the ride in a Ford
explorer any less safe... nor would I be accused of acting "maliciously"
twords Ford Motor company. I would have simply pointed out a serious issue
to the public so that they may protect themselves.

The only reason we inquired about a contract is because your operating
system has countless suid applications and your staff seems to think that
they can hide behind the non executable stack and just brush the security
issues under the rug. The fact that your operating system contains these
security issues and the fact that we are good at finding security issues is
the only reason we even attempted to contact you. The majority of this
research was done prior to contacting you ... and the fact that we were
attempting to talk about a contract did not influence the work we had
already done. One side effect of the research we had already done was that
we discovered that your non-executable stack was worthless.

We were NOT offering to "sell" you our "exploits" nor were we offering to
sell you "the means by which to bypass the non-executable stack" we were
simply proposing to you that we work on future releases and help to secure
the state of your OS as it stands now and how it presents itself in the
future. The fact that we bypassed your stack is besides the point...people
disclose security holes all the time. The information we found was scheduled
for release the the public regardless of if you choose to work with us on
future issues of not. The fact that we had bypassed your stack did however
make several of your existing practices (like leaving suids all over the
place) a little more of a concern which is why we contacted you.

We are not attempting to slander your company in anyway nor are we
attempting to tarnish your reputation because you choose not to work with
us. We never implied that we wished to harm you in any way shape or form nor
did we imply that we wished to harm any of your property or staff. We simply
wanted to help in an area that you seem to lack.... computer security.

Based on your previous email Snosoft as a company will now assume that "The
will of Compaq" is to NOT work with Snosoft in securing the TRU64 os. So at
this point in time we will make NO further requests for any contract work...
because you have NOW made it clear that you do not want our assistance.

Our intellectual property (research) however still remains to be ours and we
will release the information as we see fit. NONE of the information we
release was in any way shape or form a part of the proposed contract work
because that information was not "For sale" to begin with. The only thing
for sale and the only service we wished to offer you was an Audit of the
current state of your security and our proposed solutions to the issues at
hand.
