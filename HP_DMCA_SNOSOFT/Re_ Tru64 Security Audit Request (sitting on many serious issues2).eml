Guys I also read over your response again and wanted to make one point in
particular clear...
> ...system and your expressed intention to begin releasing proof of concept
code/binaries and advisories relating to this alleged >vulnerability at
5:00pm on June 26, 2002 unless Compaq enters into a consulting agreement
with SnoSoft.

I believe the above misunderstanding is why you have chosen to escalate to
this point...  we already were scheduled for release of information
regardless of if you decided to work with us or not. Please understand we as
a company offer source code audits and penetration testing we try to solicit
this where ever possible. We also support Full disclosure of security
research. We do give vendors a chance to indefinately purchase the
information from us so that it becomes their intellectual property, however
if a vendor chooses not to take this opportunity we will follow the Industry
standard for disclosure of somputer security holes. Examples include the
method devised by "Rain Forrest Puppy" from wiretap. A "heads up" advisory
will be given so that you have time to provide a work around, CERT will be
notified and perhaps a responsible disclosure routine will be enacted
through CERT.

I believe the reason a date was given to you was so that this info did not
catch you off gaurd... it was my understanding that our companies had been
in some form of contact for several months ... I was under the impression
from some of the responses to previous emails that you actually did wish to
work with us. We choose to with hold alot of information from the general
public in hopes that you actually wanted to work with us. I think you
actually know this is the case...

It is kind of funny how this timeline plays out ... lets review.... the
mailing lists begin talking about how to bypass the non-executable stack...
sometime within that timeframe we contact you with our concerns and offers
to audit... no earth moving response from you comes along... AFTER we let
you know we were sitting on a few things still no real response to if you do
or do not want to work with us... then we decide to disclose a couple issues
to the public because we have been sitting on them entirely too long... at
the time we were not sure that they were exploitable. We were not sure
inlight of the talks a few weeks earlier about how people thought your
non-exec could NOT be bypassed... we ourselves were supporters of the fact
that it could not be done. IMMEDIATELY there after you release a bunch of
issues to the public ... oddly enough you knocked quite a bit of our
possible research (that we let you know about ) out of the water...  Below
are a few examples of what I am talking about ....

.... (several researchers commented on this saying it was not possible)


So the below assumption that we were going to "start" releasing some of this
information "unless Compaq enters into a consulting agreement with SnoSoft"
is simply a misunderstanding... we had already begun the disclosure process.
We have already been openly talking about it with the bugtraq community long
before you decided you did not wish to work with us.

To make it clear once again the below letter is the First time you have made
it known to us that you do not wish our services in helping you secure your
OS nor do you wish to pay us to with hold any of our research from the
public eye. After recieving the below letter we have agreed to no longer
"solicit" our services.

Having that out of the way ... we will have to discuss with CERT the proper
method for handeling this situation... the date of the 26th was already
being pushed back due to other items on our plate, however inlight of your
sudden hostility twords us this date has been suspended indefinately pending
any sort of disclosure procedures that CERT deems necessary. Also due to the
government usage of TRU64 in situations which they feel the machines are
safe from attack (because of the non-execuatable stack) we may also
coordinate with NIPC.

Re: Tru64 UNIX

Dear Mr. Desautels:

I am writing in response to your claim that SnoSoft has discovered a means
of bypassing the non-executable stack on the Tru64 Unix operating system and
your expressed intention to begin releasing proof of concept code/binaries
and advisories relating to this alleged vulnerability at 5:00pm on June 26,
2002 unless Compaq enters into a consulting agreement with SnoSoft. Although
we encourage our customers and other members of the UNIX community to bring
potential bugs to our attention, we do not compensate third parties for
bringing such bugs to our attention or for keeping them a secret.

Please be advised that SnoSoft's releasing of such information, together
with SnoSoft's activities to date, could constitute criminal conduct under
both the Massachusetts extortion statute (M.G.L. c. 265 § 25) and the
federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It could also expose SnoSoft to civil
liability for damages suffered by Compaq and its customers. If SnoSoft were
to post this information as planned, Compaq would have no choice but to
evaluate its options to preserve and protect its assets, including potential
legal action against SnoSoft and referring this matter to the Office of the
United States Attorney as well as the local District Attorney for criminal
prosecution.

Please confirm that SnoSoft will refrain from publishing this information.

Regards,
